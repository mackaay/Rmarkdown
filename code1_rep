You can use Markdown to embed formatting instructions into your text. For example, you can make a word italicized by surrounding it in asterisks, bold by surrounding it in two asterisks, and monospaced (like code) by surrounding it in backticks:

*italics*
**bold**
`code`
You can turn a word into a link by surrounding it in hard brackets and then placing the link behind it in parentheses, like this:

To create titles and headers, use leading hastags. The number of hashtags determines the header's level:

# First level header
## Second level header
### Third level header



To make a bulleted list in Markdown, place each item on a new line after an asterisk and a space, like this:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
You can make an ordered list by placing each item on a new line after a number followed by a period followed by a space, like this

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
In each case, you need to place a blank line between the list and any paragraphs that come before it.
