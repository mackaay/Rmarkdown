You can use Markdown to embed formatting instructions into your text. For example, you can make a word italicized by surrounding it in asterisks, bold by surrounding it in two asterisks, and monospaced (like code) by surrounding it in backticks:

*italics*
**bold**
`code`
You can turn a word into a link by surrounding it in hard brackets and then placing the link behind it in parentheses, like this:

To create titles and headers, use leading hastags. The number of hashtags determines the header's level:

# First level header
## Second level header
### Third level header



To make a bulleted list in Markdown, place each item on a new line after an asterisk and a space, like this:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
You can make an ordered list by placing each item on a new line after a number followed by a period followed by a space, like this

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
In each case, you need to place a blank line between the list and any paragraphs that come before it.



You can also use the Markdown syntax to embed latex math equations into your reports. To embed an equation in its own centered equation block, surround the equation with two pairs of dollar signs like this,

$$1 + 1 = 2$$
To embed an equation inline, surround it with a single pair of dollar signs, like this: $1 + 1 = 2$.

You can use all of the standard latex math symbols to create attractive equations.
